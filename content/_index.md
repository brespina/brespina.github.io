i am brandon. i'm a computer science graduate from the university of houston.


i love to learn. i love to solve puzzles.

my current interests are with learning linux, zsh, and vim. 

i am a beginner and decided go with linux fedora as it came recommended from a friend.

unfortunately, the idea of free and open source software is something that captivated me recently. so down the rabbit hole i go. 

zsh, or zshell, was also recommended by the same friend. i have not used it enough to tell a difference in functionality quite yet, however, installing oh-my-zsh gave me a solid three hours of enjoyable customization for my terminal. procrastination at its finest.

vim, i have only recently decided to take the plunge. i figured i have my whole career ahead of me so now is the best time to start. still a beginner so currently spamming a lot of `b, w, e, 0, $, dd` to name a few. and the more i use it the more i wish i had started sooner. not having to use the mouse feels like a layer of friction, that i was previously unaware of, has disappeared. i cannot wait until i get better.
