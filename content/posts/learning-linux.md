with discovering open source and free software, my curiosity drove me to learn about a free operating system. the fact that this even exists is such an important concept. linux distributions can be very lightweight, this allows the whole world to have access to the internet since this is the perfect choice for underdeveloped countries for example. an old laptop with a free lightweight os. it's honestly incredible.
