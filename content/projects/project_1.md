Frequency and Spatial Filtering for Periodic Noise Removal:

here we were tasked to use fourier transform on a signal. our signal is an image but to apply the fourier transform we have to note two things:

1. treat the entire image as one period. 
2. we have to use the discrete fourier transform instead of continuous since image pixels [i][j] can only be integers
